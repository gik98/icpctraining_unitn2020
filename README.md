# Training for the ACM - ICPC competition @ UniTN, 2020 edition

Every year, UniTN sponsors the participation of some teams of students in the regional contest of the ICPC competition. 
The International Collegiate Programming Contest is the oldest programming competition, running since the seventies.

In order to participate, teams are selected in the following way:

* Universities organise local competitions to select the beast teams to send to the regional contest.

    * @UniTN: We run a series of meetings to train on the ACM-ICPC problems, after which, a local competition is held to select one (or more) teams.

* The best teams participate in a regional contest; Italy belongs to the SWERC group, whose competitions are normally held in November.
    * @UniTN: The expenses to participate in the event are (almost) fully covered by UniTN. The selected teams perform additional training from September to November.
    
* The best teams in the regional contest participate in the world contest, usually held on the next year.
    * @UniTN: We never got to that pointâ€¦
